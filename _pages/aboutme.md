I was born and raised in the beautiful (and occasionally very cold) city of [Winnipeg, Manitoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg). 

I'm classically trained in piano and hold an ACCM diploma in piano performance. I'm also self taught in guitar, cello, and harmonica. I earned a second degree black belt in Taekwondo from World Taekwondo, but these days I can be found lifting weights or playing basketball.
